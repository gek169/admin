# SUDO IS BLOAT, DOAS IS BLOAT, REAL DJENTOO USERS USE ADMIN

yes that's right the all new sudo replacement, clocking in at just 18k it is half the size of doas and 10% the size of sudo,
(compiled with GCC)

YES THAT'S RIGHT you aren't a *real* free software enthusiast unless you install this program. It's under the GPLv3.

unlike other, weaker, inferior programs written by soydevs this program...

* Prints out stallman's dating bio as you type your password. Maybe he will get a girlfriend someday this way.
* contains no manual pages, true nerds don't read manuals. they run the command and hope it prints out a help screen.
* has a really obvious name for its config file with a very obvious format, it's just called "allowed_to_run_as_root" and it
is in etc. If you have question marks or exclamation marks around your name in that file, you're allowed to run things as root.
* Won't tolerate nonsense. You try to mock my program? it mocks you back. go home, nerds
* has zero CVEs. that's right, the 39k bloated doas has 2, and sudo has like a lot. Nevermind the fact they have 
much larger user bases, they have CVEs, so they must be bad programs. Mine has none (July 8, 2021)!
* small enough to fit in the BASIC memory of a commodore 64, even when compiled with the bloated and enormous GCC with glibc.

# Configuration options

Most configuration options are at compiletime, such as the secure path.

There are two relevant configuration files- /etc/allowed_to_run_as_root and /etc/secure_environment_vars
